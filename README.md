This is an online rule builder tool. Currently customized for dynamically creating/editing rules for illnesses/diseases. 


This can be used to create any kind of rule definitions and/or for building queries. 


I will be providing a rule execution page shortly, which will allow the user to input the variable values and execute the rules and view the results.


Also in the pipeline is an easy way to import your own set of query parameters, then build rules on top of them, and finally execute the rules based on parameter values to view the results
